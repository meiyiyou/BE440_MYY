"""This module generates in-house gene sets based on ontologies.

By creating gene sets based on the the GO:0009755 (hormone-mediated signaling pathway),
we can identify if there are any entities that are part of multiple hormone-mediated 
pathways. These are our "cross-talk regions" of interest (de Anda-JÃ¡uregui et al. 
BMC Systems Biology).

The output of this module can be used for analysis
    -   Generated a network based on gene ontology (nodes are individual genes positioned
        based on the particular ontology node)
    -   Genes that are part of multiple ontologies can be an edge between the ontology node
        Ontologies also have defined relations/edges already between themselves
    -   GSEA is possible from these gene sets
