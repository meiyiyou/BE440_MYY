"""This module handles in-house gene set along with enrichment analysis

By creating gene sets based on the the GO:0009755 (hormone-mediated signaling pathway),
we can identify if there are any entities that are part of multiple hormone-mediated 
pathways. These are our "cross-talk regions" of interest (de Anda-JÃ¡uregui et al. 
BMC Systems Biology).
